/*
WAP to implement Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm for Single Source Shortest path problem. Your program should use priority queue implementation. Check your program on the following directed graph. The graph should be implemented by adjacency list.

   s    t    x    y    z
s  0   10   INF   5   INF
t  INF  0    1    2   INF
x  INF INF   0   INF   4
y  INF  3    9    0    2
z  7   INF   6   INF   0
